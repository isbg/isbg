Todo list
=========

High priority
-------------
* ☐ Delete the semi-encryption of passwords (Security through obscurity !=
  security) and use `keyring` to store and retrieve them.

Other stuff
-----------
* ☐ Export documentation.
* ☐ Add documentation about development.
* ☐ Easily upload to pypi.
* ☐ Auto report messages to Razor (high scoring ones that are definitely spam)
* ☐ Seperate out messages that may be false positives (scores close to
  SpamAssassin thresholds) from the definite spam ones.
* ☐ Add documentation for the crontab usage.
* ☐ Remove the *SpamAssassin* report from a mail when it is in the `ham`
  folder.
